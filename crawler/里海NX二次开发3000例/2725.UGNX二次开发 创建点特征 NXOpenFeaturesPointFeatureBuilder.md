### UGNX二次开发 创建点特征 NXOpenFeaturesPointFeatureBuilder

#### 代码

```cpp
 NXOpen::Point3d point = {0.0,0.0,0.0};
 NXOpen::Session* theSession = NXOpen::Session::GetSession();
 NXOpen::Part* workPart(theSession->Parts()->Work());
 NXOpen::Point* facePoint = workPart->Points()->CreatePoint(point);
 NXOpen::Features::Feature* nullNXOpen_Features_Feature0(NULL);
 NXOpen::Features::PointFeatureBuilder* pointFeatureBuilder1;
 pointFeatureBuilder1 = workPart->BaseFeatures()->CreatePointFeatureBuilder(nullNXOpen_Features_Feature0);
 pointFeatureBuilder1->SetPoint(facePoint);
 NXOpen::NXObject* nXObject0;
 nXObject0 = pointFeatureBuilder1->Commit();
 pointFeatureBuilder1->Destroy();
